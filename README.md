*Release Notes*
- text-to-image works, but I'm still having trouble getting image-to-image mode to function properly.
- You can view all of the images you've generated in the sidebar gallery page, but if you do all of your settings for the main SD3 image generation page disappear when you navigate back, I'm working on fixing that functionality as well.
