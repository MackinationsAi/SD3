Once downloaded, click the install.bat file, then click the run_SD3.bat file & you'll be good to go.

Now that homebrew & python3 installed on your machine (if they weren't already), open your main terminal & run the following command to install git, bash & pyenv then close terminal:

    brew install git bash pyenv

Navigate to your SD3 folder & right-click on it. At the bottom of the pop-up menu you will see 'New Terminal at Folder' click on it. Terminal will be open at your 
    
    sed -i -e 's/\r$//' install.sh run_SD3.sh
    sudo chmod 755 install.sh run_SD3.sh
    bash install.sh
    
This will correct any errors when running .sh scripts made on windows, grant executable premissions for both .sh scripts & install everything need to run this repo. Upon completion terminal will close. Reopen terminal using the same method as above, & run the following command:
    
    bash run_SD3.sh
    
You will be prompted in terminal by Streamlit for your email, just hit enter to ignore it & you'll be good to go. The SD3_WebUI will automatically open in your default browser, Happy Generating!

*A Stability.Ai [account](https://platform.stability.ai/) is needed to get a [SAI API Key](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys) in order to generate SD3 Images.*

*Release Notes*
- both text-to-image & image-to-image modes work
- api key, prompts & seed are remembered throughout the whole session (unless you change them), so you can now move between your gallery and main sd3 page w/o having to worry
